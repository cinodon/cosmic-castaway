# Cosmic Castaway

**Cosmic Castaway** is a 3D web game developed with **Three.js** as part of a university course in **Computer Graphics**. The game immerses players in a futuristic space adventure where they pilot a space collector on a tubular circuit, collecting valuable resources and avoiding or destroying obstacles.

## Gameplay Overview
In *Cosmic Castaway*, players navigate a space collector around a tubular track to:
- **Collect Cosmo Crystals**: Pick up crystals scattered along the circuit to increase your score.
- **Avoid or Destroy Obstacles**: Dodge space debris or shoot to destroy obstacles before they can damage the collector.
- **Recover Health and Upgrade Weapons**: Grab gears to regain health and break open supply crates for weapon upgrades.

Players can rotate around the tube, giving full freedom to maneuver around the circuit while collecting items and targeting obstacles. 

## Key Features
- **3D Rotation Mechanics**: Rotate freely around the tubular track to navigate obstacles and collect items from any direction.
- **Interactive Environment**: The game includes immersive particle effects and real-time 3D rendering, creating a dynamic space environment.
- **Power-Ups**: Obtain power-ups for health regeneration and weapon upgrades by interacting with specific in-game items.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D environment and implementing lighting and shading effects.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and game mechanics, handling user input and object behaviors.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structuring the interface and providing UI elements.

## How to Run the Game
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmic-castaway.git
   cd cosmic-castaway
2. Launch the server and play in localhost:port

## Controls
- **WASD or Arrow Keys**: Move the collector around the tube.
- **Space**: Fire weapons to destroy obstacles.
- **E**: Interact with objects (e.g., pick up power-ups).

## Project Objectives and Learning Outcomes
This project was developed to deepen my understanding of:

- **3D Rendering and Animation**: Using Three.js to create realistic and interactive 3D environments.
- **User Interaction in 3D Space**: Developing mechanics that allow players to rotate and move around a tubular track.
- **Real-Time Game Physics**: Implementing collision detection and response to create dynamic interactions within the game environment.
